# Note about this branch

This branch is currently in testing and contains debug code as well as UI elements. Feel free to help us testing and report bugs in our forum, but don't expect everything to work. It might, and it would be cool, but I don't expect this.

Before we'll even consider pulling this branch into master, a few things still have to be done:

* Test the thing, duh.
* Polish code and UI (and remove debug-related stuff)

Update, 20th March - seems like we're almost done. :)
